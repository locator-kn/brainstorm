# Services

A collection of ideas for services that could be implemented.

## Push notification

Push notification can be used to inform the user about currently happening activities. It could also be used to remind users about new offers etc.
Since push notifications are mainly designed for mobile, "web-only" user could fallback to email notifications.

Possible events:

* Trending trips
* very long user absence
* Feature (releases) news

## E-Mail notifications
